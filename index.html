		<p>Why does Green Guy do this for us? What is his motive? When we asked him this question, he said this:</p>
		<blockquote>I want a good world. A world where people can click a link to get freen money. What do I benefit? The happiness of people. What is more important than money? Without money, you cannot get anything in this world. That is my motive.</blockquote>
		<bdo dir="rtl">We are very thankful to have someone like Green Guy in this world.</bdo>
